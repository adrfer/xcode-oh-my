# Xcode Oh My
Simple yet quirky Xcode profile, pure badassery.

This is just an umbrella project where:

- Remarkably uncharming key bindings for Xcode live at [xcode-keybindings](https://github.com/adrfer/xcode-keybindings)
- Minimally ok-ish themes for Xcode can be found at [xcode-themes](https://github.com/adrfer/xcode-themes)
- A jazzy arsenal of Swift snippets for Xcode rest in peace at [xcode-snippets](https://github.com/adrfer/xcode-snippets)
